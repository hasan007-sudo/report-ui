However, your fluency is consistently broken down by high cognitive load, demonstrated by an average pause duration of 1.0 seconds and a very high hesitation rate (15%). You frequently use filler words and often repeat words or phrases ('only one time only') before settling on the final structure, which makes the speech uneven and requires effort from the listener. To reach the B2 level, you need to work on reducing these long pauses and improving the speed and accuracy of basic grammatical structures, especially when describing past actions."

Second, the rhythm of your English is not smooth; you tend to emphasize every syllable equally, which leads to word stress errors and a choppy flow. To improve, you should practice the stress and rhythm of English words, focusing on letting unstressed syllables relax, and work specifically on the accuracy of your short and long vowel sounds.
